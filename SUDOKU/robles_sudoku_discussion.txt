Sudoku Problem:

I had a very difficult time understanding backtracking even with heavy loads of reasearching. 
I have been stumped on this problem since it was assigned. I have attached what I worked for 
(hopefully) partial credit. 

For the sudoku problem, it is very clear that there needs to be some recursive backtracking element. When
given a simple problem, the agent should be able to solve it with minimal, or without backtracking. However,
there are times in sudoku where one has to guess, and will not know if their guesses are correct until
a few steps later. This is why backtracking is necessary for this problem. 

I was able to get all the necessary information for the sudoku puzzle and display it formatted, however,
was not able to effectively search through the puzzle and attempt solutions. Attached is my non-working code.
